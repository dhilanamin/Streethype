### The Birth of Sneaker Culture
Sneaker culture began with the dominance of basketball. With the popularity of Michael Jordan in the 1980s, the basketball star released his own shoe, which was made available to the public. (Pictured above) At the time, it was new for a star or celebrity to release their own shoe, but this essentially launched the hype and rave for sneakers. Basketball shoes in particular were special, as they allowed people to look good on and off the court. Everyone wanted to be like Michael Jordan, and the demand for his shoes have generated billions of dollar for Nike. Today, Nike continues to remake the original Jordans, which are still in heavy demand today. The shoes sell out instantaneously at each release and the demand is increasing exponentially.

At this point, sneakers are not the only thing that is in demand, streetwear brands such as Supreme have emerged in recent years. Streetwear is a style of clothing inspired by hip hop. It is designed to be a little different than societal norms, which many people liked. Celebrities adopted this culture of being different and it seemed as if everyone followed. Hip Hop artists releasing their own exclusive collaborations with brands create an overwhelming demand, ultimately making a whole community of people come together.
